# Valerium :milky_way:
My own cryptocurrency that I am writing in Python. REST API implemented via Flask. Currently functional as a proof-of-concept project but it will never ICO!

## Current TODOs:
1. Add consensus protocol :white_check_mark:
2. Re-do project architecture (was way too not be monolithic before) :white_check_mark:
3. Improve/validate asynchronicity :white_check_mark:
4. Test/Validate! :white_check_mark:  
~~5. Improve consensus algorithm~~
6. Make PoW adjust difficulty over time
7. (Stretch) Add a nice front-end for RESTful API using Flask :)
