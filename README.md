# Valerium :milky_way:
My own cryptocurrency that I am writing in Python. REST API implemented via Flask.

## Current TODOs:
1. Add consensus protocol
2. Improve and test asynchronicity
3. Improve proof-of-work algorithm
4. Re-do architechture to not be monolithic
5. (Stretch) Add a nice front-end for RESTful API using Flask :)
